# Transformer-BiLSTM Network for Denoising Phonocardiogram Signals

This repository contains the code and links to the deployed datasets for our study entitled:

**"A Robust Deep Learning based Model for Denoising Phonocardiogram Signals in Clinical Environments"**

We proposed a novel deep learning architecture for denoising real-world phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The model, named **T-BiLSTM**, combines a convolutional U-Net backbone with **Bidirectional LSTM layers** and **transformer blocks with multi-head attention** to effectively remove both ambient and physiological noise from heart sound recordings.


To allow a fair benchmark with the other models published in the literature, some scripts, i.e., config.py, matrices.py and utils.py, coming from the original LU-Net implementation developed by Shams Nafisa Ali et al.: ðŸ”— [https://github.com/ShamsNafisaAli/LU-Net-Heart-Sound-Denoising-](https://github.com/ShamsNafisaAli/LU-Net-Heart-Sound-Denoising-), were re-used in our implementations. We acknowledge and thank the authors for making their code accessible to the community.

## Quick Start Guide:

This section outlines the essential steps to prepare the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset Preparation

1. **Download Datasets**  
   - Download all required PCG datasets. Dataset links and licensing info are provided in `data_link.txt`.

2. **Compute Dataset Statistics**  
   - Run [`datasets_stats.py`](./datasets_stats.py) to analyze the datasets and prepare a summary useful for configuring the training pipeline.

3. **Preprocess and Segment Data**  
   - Run [`preprocessing_data.py`](./preprocessing_data.py) to:
     - Apply a bandpass filter (25â€“400 Hz),
     - Remove spikes and stationary noise,
     - Normalize signals to [-1, 1],
   - Output will be stored in the folder you specify in the script.

---

## Training

- Launch model training by running [`Codes/training_model.py`](./Codes/training_model.py).  
- This script loads the processed training data and trains the T-BiLSTM model using the specified loss function and optimizer.  
- Model checkpoints and training logs are automatically saved.

---

## Testing

- Run [`Codes/testing_data.py`](./Codes/testing_data.py) to:
  - Load the best model checkpoint,
  - Perform inference on unseen noisy PCG signals,
  - Calculate evaluation metrics.

Make sure to adjust paths and parameters in `config.py` before starting the pipeline.
