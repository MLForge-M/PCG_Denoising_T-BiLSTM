# Transformer-BiLSTM Network for Denoising Phonocardiogram Signals

This repository contains the code and resources for our paper:

**"A Robust Deep Learning based Model for Denoising Phonocardiogram Signals in Clinical Environments"**

We propose a novel deep learning architecture for denoising real-world phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The model, named **T-BiLSTM**, combines a convolutional U-Net backbone with **Bidirectional LSTM layers** and **Transformer blocks with multi-head attention** to effectively remove both ambient and physiological noise from heart sound recordings.

This repository was developed by extending and modifying the original **LU-Net** implementation by Shams Nafisa Ali et al.:
